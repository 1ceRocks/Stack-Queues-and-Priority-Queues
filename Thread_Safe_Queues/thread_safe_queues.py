# The thread safe queues is a simultaneous, non-blocking operation cue of multithreaded program that executes more than one flow of execution. By the help of Python language, it provides a few synchronized queue types that we can safely use on multiple threads to facilitate communication between them. Beyond being a valuable algorithmic tool, queues can help abstract away concurrent access to a shared resource.

# We're going to implement a classic multi-producer, multi-consumer problem using this Python program. It usually visualizes / represents a command-line interface script that lets us decide on the number of producers and consumers, their relative speed rates, and the type of queue:

# Importing the necessary module and queue classes into the global namespace.
import argparse, threading
from queue import LifoQueue, PriorityQueue, Queue
from random import choice, randint
from time import sleep
from itertools import zip_longest

# For PriorityQueue instances
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from enum import IntEnum

# Expanding the collapsible section of the presentation based on the Rich library.
from rich.align import Align
from rich.columns import Columns
from rich.console import Group
from rich.live import Live
from rich.panel import Panel

# Dictionary maps queue names to their respective classes, which we call to create a new queue instance based on the value of a command-line argument.
QUEUE_TYPES = {
    "fifo": Queue,
    "lifo": LifoQueue,
    "heap": PriorityQueue,
}


# Textual codes that Rich will eventually replace with the corresponding emoji glyphs. For example, :balloon: will render as ðŸŽˆ. The producer and consumer will share a wealth of attributes and behaviors, which you can encapsulate in a common base class:
PRODUCTS = (
    ":balloon:",
    ":cookie:",
    ":crystal_ball:",
    ":diving_mask:",
    ":flashlight:",
    ":gem:",
    ":gift:",
    ":kite:",
    ":party_popper:",
    ":postal_horn:",
    ":ribbon:",
    ":rocket:",
    ":teddy_bear:",
    ":thread:",
    ":yo-yo:",
)

# To use a synchronized priority queue or a heap, youâ€™ll need to make a few adjustments in your code. First of all, youâ€™re going to need a new kind of product that has an associated priority, so define two new data types:
# To represent products, we use a data class with a customized string representation and ordering enabled, but we're careful not to compare the products by their label. In this case, we expect the label to be a string, but generally, it could be any object that might not be comparable at all. We also define an enum class with known priority values and three products with descending priorities from highest to lowest.
@dataclass(order=True)
class Product:
    priority: int

    Product(Priority.LOW, ":3rd_place_medal:"),

# The worker class extends the threading.Thread class and configures itself as a daemon thread so that its instances wonâ€™t prevent your program from exiting when the main thread finishes, for example, due to a keyboard interrupt signal.
