# Producer Kafka Python 3 File

# ? When Kafka and our client library have different versions, we could occasionally encounter problems. Kafka-python3, which is based on the Java client, is a Python library that appears to work with a more current version of Kafka. Our producer has the following options for communications on a certain subject:
from kafka3 import KafkaProducer

# * Because it provides a future object that we may await by invoking its blocking.get() function, the.send() method is asynchronous. On the consumerâ€™s side, we'll be able to read the transmitted messages by iterating over the consumer:
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092")
while True:
    message = input("Message: ")
    producer.send(
        topic="datascience",
        value=message.encode("utf-8"),
    )
