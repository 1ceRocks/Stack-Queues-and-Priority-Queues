from graph import City, load_graph, dijkstra_shortest_path

nodes, graph = load_graph("Stack-Queues-and-Priority-Queues/Using Queues in Practice/roadmap.dot", City.from_dict)

city1 = nodes["london"]

for city in nx.dijkstra_path(graph, city1, city2, weight):

# Success! Both functions yield exactly the same shortest path between London and Edinburgh.
