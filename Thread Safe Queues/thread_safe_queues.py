# The thread safe queues is a simultaneous, non-blocking operation cue of multithreaded program that executes more than one flow of execution. By the help of Python language, it provides a few synchronized queue types that we can safely use on multiple threads to facilitate communication between them. Beyond being a valuable algorithmic tool, queues can help abstract away concurrent access to a shared resource.

# We're going to implement a classic multi-producer, multi-consumer problem using this Python program. It usually visualizes / represents a command-line interface script that lets us decide on the number of producers and consumers, their relative speed rates, and the type of queue:

# Importing the necessary module and queue classes into the global namespace.
import argparse
from queue import LifoQueue, PriorityQueue, Queue

# Dictionary maps queue names to their respective classes, which we call to create a new queue instance based on the value of a command-line argument.
QUEUE_TYPES = {
    "fifo": Queue,
    "lifo": LifoQueue,
    "heap": PriorityQueue,
}

# The main() function is the entry point for the command-line interface. It takes a command-line argument and returns a queue instance. 
def main(args):
    buffer = QUEUE_TYPES[args.queue]()

# Receives the parsed arguments supplied by parse_args() that we defined.
def parse_args():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("-q", "--queue", choices=QUEUE_TYPES, default="fifo")
    parser.add_argument("-p", "--producers", type=int, default=3)
    parser.add_argument("-c", "--consumers", type=int, default=2)
    parser.add_argument("-ps", "--producer-speed", type=int, default=1)
    parser.add_argument("-cs", "--consumer-speed", type=int, default=1)
    return parser.parse_args()

# TODO: support multiple producers and consumers.

        main(parse_args()))
