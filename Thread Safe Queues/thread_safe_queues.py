# The thread safe queues is a simultaneous, non-blocking operation cue of multithreaded program that executes more than one flow of execution. By the help of Python language, it provides a few synchronized queue types that we can safely use on multiple threads to facilitate communication between them. Beyond being a valuable algorithmic tool, queues can help abstract away concurrent access to a shared resource.

# We're going to implement a classic multi-producer, multi-consumer problem using this Python program. It usually visualizes / represents a command-line interface script that lets us decide on the number of producers and consumers, their relative speed rates, and the type of queue:

# Importing the necessary module and queue classes into the global namespace.
import argparse
from queue import LifoQueue, PriorityQueue, Queue

# Dictionary maps queue names to their respective classes, which we call to create a new queue instance based on the value of a command-line argument.
QUEUE_TYPES = {
    "fifo": Queue,
    "lifo": LifoQueue,
    "heap": PriorityQueue,
}
