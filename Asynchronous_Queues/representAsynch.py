# Async Priority Queues Class Inheritance Visualization
# This Python file will automatically import Job from async_queues.py and check if the validation variable with operator equal to the shortest URL path. It corresponds to the smaller values which takes precedence in a min-heap.

from async_queues import Job

job1 = Job("http://localhost/")
job2 = Job("http://localhost/:8080/")
validate = job1 < job2

print(f"\n{validate}\n") # This will print out True in the program terminal output.
